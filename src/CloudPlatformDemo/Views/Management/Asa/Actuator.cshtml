Azure Spring Apps ships with a component called LiveView that monitors apps instrumented with actuator endpoints by periodically scraping them. This information is displayed in an easy to digest LiveView UI. 
At this time, support is limited to Java Spring Apps only, but .NET apps instrumented with Steeltoe will be supported soon.
