When running on Tanzu Application Service, actuator endpoints are published on the <code>/cloudfoundryapplication</code> endpoint, 
which is protected by the platform's authentication provider (UAA). 

When viewing the application through Tanzu Application Service Application Manager, 
the data extracted from the app will be used to augment the information available when accessing app's detail page.
