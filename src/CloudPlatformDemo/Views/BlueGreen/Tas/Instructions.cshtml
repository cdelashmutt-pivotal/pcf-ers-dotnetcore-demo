<p>When running on <platformname/>, Blue/Green deployment strategy can be accomplished by deploying a new version of the app as a new app on to the platform. This will give it it's own unique URL which can be used to verify that the app works.
When you're completely satisfied, reroute traffic from existing app by allowing the new app to respond to requests at same url via <code>cf map-route</code> command, and stop old version of the app from recieving requests via <code>cf unmap-route</code> command.
Try this while the simulation is running. The name of the app that has serviced the request will be reflected in the chart.
